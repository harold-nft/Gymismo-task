# Task

## Part 1: Do a time-boxed code review (20 mins max)

Do a quick written code review of the existing code.

1. What is your overall impression on the code quality?
2. What would you look at addressing first? How would you approach that?

## Part 2: Refactoring

Refactor the code as needed.

1. Refactor the controller to reduce complexity and improve readability and maintainability
   - Feel free to write mocks/stubs where needed
2. Add jsdoc comments to the module exports as needed to document the API
3. Write unit tests for the new code
   - Can be psudocode / empty method definitions if your refactored code isn't runnable - we're more interested in what you would test and how

## Part 3: Submit

Send the code review, refactored code and resume to task@gymismo.com ðŸ™‚
